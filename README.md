# BARBIE'S TIMETABLE GENERATOR
This is a simple web application designed to schedule examinations under Ashesi University's constraints and business logic. 
It follows the model-view-controller architecture. 
The model defined in algo.py contains hybrid versions of graph colouring and the change making algorithm to generate the timetable.
The controllers defined in the .js and .php files map the user's actions on the frontend (primarily HTML and JavaScript) to the model component. 
The view consists of two simple page - a page for input upload and another for output download.
This project is deployed with AWS and available at http://13.53.102.148.
Thank you.
